Director: Ummm... Something about not found, I think. I deleted the emails.

Me: Can I remote in and take a look in your email for clues?

Director: Sure.

Me: \*starts initiating a remote support session\*

Director: I think the most recent one I sent went though.  I didn't get a kickback.

Director: I was on the phone with &lt;person from company&gt; and they said their email address was firstname.lanstname@company.com and I didn't have the dot.

Me: (connected in at this point) Can I still take a look to make certain?

Me: The next one was sent to ""firstnamelastname@company.com""

Director: That explains that...and the others?

Backstory:

I work for a company that does things completely unrelated to IT.  It's a medium sized business with many different divisions doing many different types of outdoor services for clients.  It's a big enough company to need IT infrastructure beyond a few PCs and a network switch, but small enough that the chain of command bottom to top only has 4 or 5 links.  I was hired on originally to do fieldwork (read: labor) for one of their divisions almost a decade ago.  My time in the field lasted all of 6 months before the owner of the company happened to discover through idle conversation that I had a knack for fixing things and a love of technology.  From that day forth, I have comprised the entire IT department.  I've got about 100 users across 4 offices in 3 US states.  Most of my users are lovely people, although the majority of them are largely ignorant of technology.  So I spend most of my days resetting passwords, turning things off and on again, replacing toner and running reports.  I say most users are lovely because there are a few that truly... are not.  This tale regards a user of the latter type, who was a mainstay of the company for nearly 20 years but has (thankfully) since retired.

Cast:

$Me - NoRecommendation8630 himself, in the flesh.  Certified IT adventurer.

$Rose - Elderly, but definitely not in the ""I wish you were my grandmother"" sort of way.  Terrified of two things: technology, and change.  Of course Rose is not her real name, but it does evoke imagery of the proper curly white hair.  In my mind anyway.

The Event:

Rose was very stuck in her ways and routinely refused computer and equipment upgrades because she ""doesn't like it when things are different.""  Rose frequently came across my Caller ID to complain about the slowness of her Windows XP, Core2Duo machine.  Since this was 2015, these complaints were understandable, but most of those calls went as follows, round and round for several months:

$Rose: ""$Me, this machine is so slow I'll be dead before my bank statements download!""

$Me: ""I'm sorry Rose, but your computer is beyond upgrading.  I've been trying to replace it but you always decide you'd rather stick with your familiar environment.""

$Rose: (snippily) ""Because YOU refuse to make it better without having to make it different!"" \*click\*

When her geriatric computer's poor old hard drive finally refused to load to the desktop one morning, Rose relented and authorized the upgrade.  I nervously approached her desk with a shiny new Windows 10 machine, complete with all of the software she would need and all of the files I could salvage from her quickly expiring hard drive in the best approximation of the folder structure that I could manage.  I set up the machine, helped her find the power button and log in, answered eleventy thousand (maybe I'm exaggerating but just a little) questions about Windows 10 and why it was different than Windows XP, and retreated to my own office in the next building over.  Case closed, or so I thought.  The serene feeling of a flawless deployment washed over me as I finished the second cup of terrible office coffee.  That feeling was, however, short lived.  My phone rang, and my heart hit the floor when I read the Caller ID.  Rose.

$Me: ""Hi Rose, how can I help?""

$Rose: ""YOU DELETED IT!""

$Me: ""I did what now?  I did mention that not all of your files were recoverable, but the most recent ones all were, going back a year or so, and if you're having trouble finding something I'm sure we can find it together.""

$Rose: (absolutely frantic) ""YOU DELETED (bank)!  ITS GONE!  HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?  WHAT ABOUT ALL OF THEIR OTHER CUSTOMERS AND WHAT ABOUT ALL OF OUR MONEY?! THIS HAS TO BE ILLEGA-""

$Me: (cutting her off) ""Rose, I do not control the internet, or the banks, or their websites.  I am sure I didn't delete anything like that.""

$Rose: ""YOU DID!  ITS GONE!  ITS ALL GONE!  THE BANK, MY MONEY, IT'S GONE!""

$Me: ""I'll be right over.""

I walked to her desk, slightly shaken and expecting the worst.  When I arrived, I was greeted with more frantic screeching that I will save you, dear reader, from experiencing.  It culminated in the following conversation:

$Rose: (physically stabbing the new LCD monitor with a pen) ""It used to be RIGHT HERE!  The bank used to be RIGHT HERE!""

$Me: ""On your desktop?  Was this a program?""

$Rose: (shouting again and stabbing the screen in between words) ""NO!  THE BANK!  USED TO BE!  RIGHT HERE!""

$Me: (now understanding what is happening) ""Oh, you used to have a shortcut to the bank on your desktop.  Okay, no worries, hang on I'll put it back.""

$Rose: ""I don't know what a shortcut is but you BETTER BRING BACK THAT BANK!""

I spent the next 30 seconds recreating a shortcut to the bank's login page on her desktop right beneath the black ink mark her pen jabs had left on the screen, then I clicked it and her eyes lit up but her demeanor did not change.

$Rose: ""Well it's a GOOD THING I CALLED YOU because otherwise you would have cost THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE their entire BANK ACCOUNTS!  You CAN'T just GO AROUND DELETING THINGS!  ESPECIALLY NOT BANKS! THEY'RE TOO IMPORTANT!""

I didn't have the heart to tell her that her shortcut wasn't actually in control of the bank's website, but that's okay.  To this day she probably still thinks that 3 letter bank's entire website and the data for all their accounts still lives on the desktop of the PC at her old desk.  The day I signed her retirement card I had my own little private party in my mind because while this may be the most vibrant Rose tale from my years working with her, it certainly isn't the only one.

I typically get Bs so I was stressed out but knew I would do fine on my Final Exam and be ok. Well I missed the deadline for the Final Exam and so now I have failed the class. I beg my teacher to allow me to take it since I was only a couple hours late, but he said he cannot help me since there were plenty of warnings about it and I hadn’t been very active in the class.

MC was walking towards thingX when
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah

After a while, Y happened and blah blah blah blah blah blah

A few minutes later he stumbled upon Z and blah blah blah blah blah

I hope you get the point. The transitions feel awkward.

&amp;#x200B;

After a 20 minute bicycle ride though the freezing Scandinavian winter I arrived at work and figured it would be a good idea to take a warm and refreshing shower. Luckily my workplace has some nice big bathrooms with shower facilities. I immediately head into the bathroom, drop my clothes on the floor and step into the shower and relax for a good 10-15 minutes. After finally snapping out of my catatonic shower state, I draw back the curtains and step out.. onto the overflowing bathroom floor. And by flooded I mean we probably have a good 1,5 cm/ half inch of water covering the entirety of the bathroom floor. I look over to the corner where my pile of clothes are simulating a cotton archipelago, completely saturated by the water.

So here I am butt-naked in a bathroom at my work, with no dry clothes. My first thought was to just put it back on and hurry back home to change, but being soaked in sub-zero temperature would lead to severe pneumonia under the best conditions. Second option was to make a complete power move and walk out just wearing a towel and hope i could do a series of speech 100 skill checks to gaslight everyone else into thinking they were the weird ones and hand over some of their clothes.

Luckily I had a third option, as by a stroke of pure luck I had placed my towel and my private cell phone on the sink, thus unscathed by the water. I frantically googled my work to see if I could find the number og my boss - Sucess! Now I just had to muster up the courage to call her and explain the situation and see if she could save me. It is woth noting here, that my boss is a lady in her early 30's so it was of some importance to me, that this would not come of as the plot of the average pornhub movie. Luckily she had a good laugh about it, said I was an idiot (I'll allow it) and found an old soccershirt in the break room that the dropped in front of the bathroom. That solved some of my problem, but left me with the bottom half unaccounted for. At this point however I had spend the last 10-15 minutes Twisting my jeans and running them under the hand dryer, so they had reached a state of acceptable humidity under the circumstances.

At this point it was about as good as I was going to get it, so I went commando into the jeans and put on the soccershirt and brought the rest of my clothes to a drying cabinet. At this point I had no option but to get back to work while waiting for my blue collar suit to dry up and just embrace the humiliation and question from my colleagues about why I was dressed like I was going to a festival. Knowing there is no way to stop the rumors from spreading, I have figured I'll just embrace the situation and get a good laugh with everyone else.

There's a lot of build up to this so please bear with me. (L) 

I have been working from home part-time since before ye old pandemic (call center) and the empty time during quarantine was driving me crazy. I was looking for a way to fill the rest of my time. I couldn't really settle on a hobby and bounced around a few different options. 


I have had cats my whole life, I love them. At the time I had three of my own and was kitten-sitting two for a (now ex) friend who had moven cross country. When she eventually decided she wasnt coming back for them. I struggled to find them homes because, I hate Facebook and everyone in my contact list had various reasons they couldn't take them, I ended up contacting a local rescue that was 100% non kill to help me. The rescue was extremely nice and made a deal with me. If I could 'foster' them a while longer, they would post the cats online and put them up at their adoption events every weekend until they were adopted. 

I was very happy with the deal and every friday, I drove the cats to (insert pet store *where the pets go* here) and would pick them up on Sunday. I of course bonded with the group of volunteers and pet fosters and their pets and after a couple of months of us getting to know each other, they approached me about taking a third foster cat. I agreed and over the course of the next few months, three became 7. I found a hidden talent in getting kittens to eat, and nursing sick kittens back to health. 

I would have anywhere from 13 - 18 cats in my home at any time and my neighbors, who I was decently close with, often joked about me being a crazy cat lady but made sure to tell me I was 'doing God's work'. I've been riding on a moral high for a while. My old neighbors moved out last summer and a new family moved in about a month later. There were two twin boys, who are around 10 and their mom. They were always outside playing and very eager to help me. After a few weeks they asked me if I needed help with any yard work so I paid them to rake my yard/ pick up sticks a few times. 

Since they were outside playing a lot, they saw me coming and going all the time with foster cats. They don't have any pets and were very excited every time they saw me with cats. They ended up asking their mom if they could come pet the cats at my house and she walked them over so they could ask and I agreed. 

The mom and I eventually struck a deal for me to babysit them for about an hour after school, until she was able to come home from work. For about three weeks they would come pet the cats after school and then when their mom got back from work, they'd go home. This worked out for me because I was able to socialize the cats for adoption easier, these kids are loud and energetic.

Right before Christmas, Wasabi, one of their favorite kittens, was adopted. and they noticed he was gone and asked where he went. I explained that I was just a temporary mom for all the kittens and that I helped them go to their forever home. 

This really just seemed to make them more upset. They  both got really quiet and when their mom came, they left. I figured they just really missed Wasabi. 

The mom approached me the next morning and said I didn't need to babysit them anymore/ that she had it covered. I thought it was weird for her to randomly cancel but maybe, they were REALLY upset and the mom didn't want them to get attached to any other cats they couldn't keep. I didn't really see them outside much after this, but it's been really cold here and I don't go outside much anymore either.

Fast forward to today, I caught the mom and boys at the store and tried to make friendly conversation with them, when one started crying and the other soon followed. The mom sent them to her car and pulled me to the side to tell me what was happening. 

She explained that her husband had passed away very suddenly about a month before they moved next-door to me and she had told the boys that earth was a temporary home and that heaven was their dad's forever home and that they would be able to see him again in heaven. She admitted that her explanation was weak but didn't know what else to say to them. This WHOLE TIME, they thought I was a murderer, and all the cats I were cycling through my home, I was taking to heaven. They've been too scared to come to my house, and their mom didn't know what to do to fix it. She apologized for waiting so long but hoped they would forget the whole thing. 

I followed her to her car where the boys were waiting for her, and tried to explain in better terms this time, that all cats and kittens were indeed alive and that I had adoption paperwork and pictures to prove it. (I don't have it on hand, the rescue does) 

They, of course, called my bluff and so I contacted the adopter to hopefully get some current pictures of Wasabi and now I'm sitting here, writing this post, hoping that the adopter sees my email within the next few hours so I can prove to these kids I'm not a kitten murderess.

At the time, I was bullied horrendously. It was so bad that I couldn't trust adults at school because they were so incompetent, let alone the other kids, so I was selectively mute. I would not talk to *anyone* at school unless they were my one or two friends, mainly because I was absolutely terrified of everyone. I didn't have a cellphone because my mom didn't think I was old enough nor could we afford it.

I was in the orchestra class and we were supposed to carpool to this venue to play for a concert. There was no written memo about it, my orchestra instructor just told us where to meet and who we were carpooling with. I worked up the courage to ask *where* I needed to be and with *who* exactly because I was new to the school, and didn't know where that exit was. I couldn't seem to get a straight answer from anyone, as the directions from the couple people I asked were extremely vague.

The day came where I was supposed to go, I had forgotten exactly which exit, and people cleared out of the school super quickly after the day was over so there wasn't someone around to ask. I had no idea what to do or where to go, and by the time I could find someone, the orchestra people had left. So, I just sat in the office and was reading a book, hoping my mom would realize that maybe I was still in the school and to come get me. I had no way to call her because she didn't have a cellphone either.

The longest time passed, I hoped my mom would just swing by the school but she didn't as she drove to the venue. Soon the staff was leaving, and I panicked thinking I would get locked in. So, I went to the police station that was next to the school and stuttered out that I was lost and had no way to contact my mom. They let me hang out while I waited for anything and soon I saw my mom's car outside the windows.

I raced back to the school, and when I entered, she was crying and screaming my name. When I showed up, she was absolutely relieved and asked me what happened. I could barely stutter out any explanation, and was waiting to get absolutely reemed. Another reason why I didn't ask for help, is that when I didn't know something or how to do something or I made a mistake, my parents' reaction was to be really mean. To my surprise, that didn't happen, and we just calmly went home.

We never talked about it after that day.

So yeah, 12-13 year old me was a big dummy dumb dumb dumb.

TL;DR: I missed my carpool, waiting in the office for my mother at school, but when staff started leaving, I went to the police station next door. My mom went to the place I was supposed to be dropped off at, found I wasn't there, came back to the school and had a panic attack/breakdown because she couldn't find me.

A little long but here goes. Massive fuckup from my end. This morning I (23M) woke up early, as organised as ever. I had my perfect plan for the day; walk over to my local trusted florist (about 7:30am), get a huge bouquet of roses for my girlfriend (let’s call her M, 21F), get to the station for my business trip to another city and return tonight in time for our dinner. I’m a normally meticulous person, but for some reason this morning distraction took over and halfway to the florist (I was walking as it’s a short distance from my house) I realised I had left my wallet home. “No problem”, I thought. “I’ve known these guys since I was a kid, they’ll let me pay later or tomorrow right?”
Well, lo and behold for some baffling reason they were closed (on Valentine’s Day??????). Already tight on time I ran a short distance further to another florist who wouldn’t let me come back and pay later. Defeated, I walked back home when I passed a building which I shit you not had a MASSIVE ROSE BOUQUET RESTING ON THE GATE. I thought once, twice, three times then just took it since it looked pretty abandoned and nobody was around. I’ve had lots of unique things happen to me over the course of my life which could’ve easily solved a lot of problems and I’ve stupidly ignored them due to morals or other reasons, so I wasn’t gonna pass on this divine rescue. I went to my gf’s house, dropped them on her front door and left, happy that she’d be happy.
Well that feeling was to be short lived when 30 minutes later I look down at my phone to be greeted by 6 missed calls (I have DND mode) and 41 WhatsApp notifications with a barrage of insults and heartbreak.
It turns out that the flowers had a NOTE attached  which i totally did not see (and i did take a good look at the flowers). Said note was addressed to a certain  “V” by her boyfriend (you guessed it, with a name that starts with my same initial and THIS MOTHERFUCKER SIGNED OFF WITH JUST THE INITIAL) who profusely apologised for cheating, saying he didn’t know what got into him, saying he only loved her ecc, to not break up, ecc the usual. 
So not only did my gf find herself with a “cheating” boyfriend on Valentine’s Day, but she also got a note HAND DELIVERED by me in which she is called by another name, so now she must think she’s the side piece and that I’m enough of a dumbass to have mixed the two of them up and sent her the flowers while in reality they were for this “V” who I was supposedly cheating on with my gf. The one time I took an opportunity…. Well fuck me

Dinner will be interesting tonight…  
 
TL;dr forgot my wallet, my usual florist was closed, other florist wouldn’t do credit, found flowers and took them to my gf thinking I had played the system but they had a note to some random girl in which her boyfriend apologised for cheating on her.

EDIT 1: I don’t want people to think I went out of my way to steal stuff, so I would like to specify something; I guess I forgot to specifically emphasise that these roses were leaning against the building’s BACK gate which has a trash skip next to it… they weren’t quite in the skip but they were resting against this back gate which is both less practical and less accessible than say the main gate, plus it’s a service entrance surrounded by trash. In my area all buildings have porters which open at 7:30 am so he could’ve easily just entered the building and left them on the door or with the porter.

My theories are either the girl saw them, knew who they were from and trashed them or this guy put them in that specific place for some absurd reason.

UPDATE 1: the response to this has been epic. Positive and negative comments, thank you. And a special thank you to all the awards, really amazing. On my way to pick her up now, so bear with me until later tonight or tomorrow morning. I’ll also do my best to reply to everyone individually as I’ve done so far. Bye for now guys/gals.

FINAL UPDATE: well guys, all’s well that ends well. We met for dinner, I picked her up with 79 roses and her new handbag and the first thing she did was flick my nose and say “you dumbass”.  I tried to explain what happened but she just kept laughing her ass off at the story and eventually I just burst out too. In the end I told her the whole story, complete truth from A to Z and not a single lie. She said she never doubted me for a second and that she knew from a variety of factors (handwriting, my character, the trust she has in me, the greatness of our relationship etc) that it could not have been me but she could’ve never thought I ended up finding flowers on my way back from failing to buy them. She said she ignored me because she wanted to “punish” (jokingly) me for getting her flowers off the street but said she appreciated my resourcefulness. We had a great dinner at this French restaurant and she’s currently asleep next to me, I’ll be joining her soon. I’m just looking at e her thinking how lucky I am, how beautiful this girl is and how blessed I am to receive her love, care and affection every day. Makes me smile and I’m just so happy about us. I also found out the reason my florist was closed is that he opened literally mere minutes after I left because his little kid l had diarrhoea and basically shit all over himself and the bed early in the morning, so he had to be cleaned up and changed. So not incredibly interesting as many would’ve hoped BUT there’s a bonus; my building’s porter came back to me with some “gossip” after I asked her to investigate said flowers - apparently this dude got caught cheating on his gf (V) ages ago and he’s still trying to win her back.  It got to the point where V instructed her porter to take anything and everything this dude tried to leave for her straight to the trash area as she doesn’t even want to see it and has completely shut out this guy. So I was right all along and I didn’t really steal anything as it was abandoned, unwanted and would’ve gone to a junkyard. I guess all the assholes calling me a thief and wishing me ill are currently in shambles, re evaluating their mediocrity. 

So in conclusion; everything went great, it was just a really unique set of circumstances which evolved into a funny story that terrified me for the smallest amount of time but will make a great, amazing, hilarious topic of conversation for many years to come.

She did say she was never gonna let me live this down in a million years and I am currently known as the Valentine Bandit. 

To everyone who was nice, funny, supportive and positive I want to give each and everyone of you a massive thank you, thank you for your positivity, for the laughs and the awards. I will make sure to do my best and reply to the remaining comments individually but I’ll do so tomorrow.

To those who insulted me, wished me disgrace and just generally came spreading negativity I only got one thing to say: 😘

Take away from this story: don’t steal flowers off the street, and if you must do so make sure there’s no notes anywhere in the vicinity of said flowers.

We were discussing the notes we left for the writer after we finished giving him feedback two weekends ago. One of the readers noted that some parts of the central mystery were lacking due to not accounting for some clues mentioned in the book until that point.

For instance, let's assume a victim was found dead in the kitchen of their home and tied to the stove. After getting caught, at one point, a character asks the 'supposed culprit' to tie her shoes, but the culprit doesn't know how to tie her shoes at all. So she could be innocent, because she wouldn't be able to tie the victim to the stove. And that's just a small clue.

So to move to the last sequence and merge the subplots together, a scene was structured to gather all findings. The alpha-reader said the scene should include every bit of clue, but I disagreed, pointing out that some clues should be there for and only the reader, just like the example above; it shouldn't be mentioned in the scene. It'll add to the re-reading experience. At the same time, the scene was jam-packed with loads of information already and the final sequence doesn't mention the state of the victim. After all, that doesn't matter to the plot in the slightest. It's but a small hint, again, for the reader.

But at the end, it's up to the writer.

I went on my first date today with a girl from tinder whose profile read ""lover of movies, TV and books"", so I swiped she matched back. (my profile talked about my job and dog). We started chatting, and she was nice, so we agreed to meet at a cafe for brunch. We began with pleasantries, and then I asked her about her favourite movies and books (lord of the rings, a few good men, Selma, moonlight and star wars"". lord of the rings and star wars gave me the (false) impression she was a little bit nerdy. so I followed up with ""do you like any games?"" she said her dad loved them and had been playing them all his life. I asked if she ever had a go at them. she said ""at rugby? I'd get flattened"". So I had seen the misunderstanding and clarified video games.

Strike one.

She soured immediately. She told me how she could hear her brother screaming racial slurs and the foulest things at strangers every night. When he wasn't playing them, he repeated those same things to her. she told me how they were overly violent, utterly sickening, profoundly misogynistic. A blight to humanity. ""do you play them?"" she said with a glare as cold as ice. Now I couldn't exactly tell her that in the last six months, I'd completed pokemon legends Arceus, every donkey kong country game, prey 2006/2017, horizon zero dawn, Bayonetta 1/2, metal gear solid 1-4, and reached platinum in overwatch. So out of force of habit, I said, ""god no, I just thought you liked nerdy things because you said you like star wars"". she still suspects I'm lying and then follows up with, ""so what do you like"" for the rest of my life, I'll never know what possessed me to say my true 2nd love ""oh my god, I absolutely love anime.""

Strike two.

She didn't even have to speak. I saw the colour fade from her face as she looked at me like a wild beast. ""the shows that perverts watch?!"" instead of stopping to think about what I was saying, I quickly rushed to defend my position ""it's not for perverts it's a medium and there's lots of-"" ""there's a pillow in my parent's house of an eight-year-old with her shirt off and you're saying it's normal?"" I could no longer debate her as she was correct. There are sect's of anime that are repulsive, but I'm not sure I could convince her to separate the two. So I said, ""maybe we're not right for each other"" at this, I'm trying to leave as quickly as possible. I got up and started to leave abruptly. ""ARE YOU NOT FUCKING PAYING!?""

Strike three.

To be fair, I agreed to pay when we were ordering, but I could no longer take the embarrassment and sprinted out the door, got in my car, drove home and cried.

TLDR

I lied about not liking video games but made it worse by saying I loved anime.

She then said ""I can't see anywhere to park"" and I explained that I'd parked untidily in order to save her a space and to just wait a minute while I moved my car over.

I did that and beckoned her over, whereupon she turned the car round and drove out of the car park.

I assumed she'd misunderstood and had gone to park on the street so I followed on foot in order to walk back with her. While I was walking my phone rang and she said ""I'm in the car park but I've just driven past you. Where did you park?""

There followed a considerable amount of confusion until I got back to the car park and saw that she had neither changed her hair colour nor put on weight.

I look nothing like my brothers or sisters and they look nothing like me. As a matter of fact, no two Ideas look alike. Some are big. Others are small. Where some have slender curves, others are cut from sharp angry lines. I’ve seen ideas with skin shades darker than the pit and others with skin so pale they could be luminous. We are all distinct, different, separate yet we share the same curse. The same burden that we must all bear – the curse of the Labyrinth.

To survive the first moments of the Pit-shore is simply the beginning. Those who survive must walk the Labyrinth of the Mind. It is home to us all. Narrow halls and tall concrete walls. Wide passages and thin paper walls. The Labyrinth is beyond huge. It lies just beyond the pit-shore; an architectural marvel. From the pits, there is no other destination for any survivor but the Labyrinth. 

It is in the Labyrinth that we mature. We become even more distinct. It is in the labyrinth that we have the chance to prove ourselves. It is in the Labyrinth that our fates are decided but even though the Labyrinth is home, it is also a battlefield. And the only true way out is the Light.

Many have seen the Light but few have gone into it. The Elders tell us it is a transition into another realm, one higher than the Labyrinth. I have never experienced the Light myself but I have been told that it appears for a few moments before an Idea and if that Idea does not take his chance, the Light disappears and it is gone forever. I have never heard of an Idea getting a second chance at the Light. If one misses the Light, all that is left is the darkness of the Labyrinth.

The Labyrinth is alive. It moves. It constricts. It changes. It expands. There is no end to it. I have seen many Ideas waste away walking its halls. I have seen many Ideas simply go mad and stop being. My sister was one of them. I held her in my arms as the madness consumed her and she became one with the dust once again. It is different from wasting at the Pit-shore. There is something even sadder, more visceral about it. When I lost my brother at the Pit-shore, it was painful but it was the loss of a stranger. Someone I never knew. My sister and I had survived the Pit-shores and we had walked the Labyrinth hand in hand for ages. Losing her felt like losing a part of myself. 

But wasting away is simply one of the dangers in the Labyrinth. There are traps, pit-falls and many unmentionable things but one danger stands separate from the rest – Ideakillers. Ideakillers are monsters that invade the Labyrinth from a world beyond. They only have one purpose – to hunt and to destroy Ideas. They are unnatural and they carry out their assignment with an unnatural thirst. The Elders tell us it is impossible to stand up to an Ideakiller. The only option is to run. And so we do. 
And so I should have done. 

Or so I would have done if not for the fact that behind the beast was the Light. 

The hallway was narrow and the Beast took up covered any pathway to the Light. The Light, a beacon of hope that it was, cast a long shadow of the beast and made it even more of a nightmare. It was made of dust, ashes and shadows and adorned with claws and fangs made of the darkest of nights. Its growl sent shivers down my spine and sent every Idea in the mile radius running for their lives. They were smart to do so. I would have joined them if not for the beautiful song that drowned out the sounds of the beast and chased fear from my mind.

The Light was almost magnetic in nature. It drew me in like a moth to flame and it filled me with courage like never before. The Ideakiller was no longer a beast that had killed many of my brethren. It was simply an obstruction on my way to the Light. 
I searched around for a weapon with which I would face my opponent but there was nothing but a branch of rotten wood. As soon as I picked it up, the beast was upon me; a flurry of fangs and claws. I dodged to the left and right and then to the left again but the beast gave me no reprieve. It scratched and clawed and roared, dark spittle flying everywhere but the song of the Light filled my bones with just enough power that I managed to stay a moment ahead of it. 

But then the Light began to dim and its song with it. The weariness returned to me and the beast at long last managed a hit; a slash at my chest. The pain knocked me back. My blood seemed to calm it for a moment and it snarled at me. But my focus was not on it, I looked beyond its terrifying façade to see the Light. Where it had been a massive beacon of salvation, it was now dwindling. Time was wasting.
I hardened my grip on my weapon and rushed at the beast. As soon as I was within range, I threw the branch with all my strength directly at its eyes. The branch sailed across the space between us but I did not wait to see if it would hit its target. While the beast was distracted by my makeshift projectile, I bolted past it towards the Light. It realized my plan and rushed after me; its hulking footstep haunting me as I reached for the Light but it was too late. I had won.

I stepped into the Light and everything changed.",False,shortstories,t5_2qhmi,self,[FN]. IDEAS,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/ss7ju6/fn_ideas/,2022,2,0.0,,,,,

This was three-ish years ago, he crashed my car in the process while being a DD, and dropped the face of the Earth after a few months of knowing him. Found out that after blacking out, my friends barely notified of his intentions by his small quips of ""oh we will have a good time"".

I found out why he dropped off so suddenly, he was in for Burglary and Theft, which he barely got out of Prison for. He also made this elaborate lie of him going through a Doctorates program at our university for Psychology. Asked him once what the difference of Borderline Personality Disorder, and Multiple Personality Disorder as I actually wanted an answer; he answered with most unsatisfactory way, with a mix of ""ah thats difficult to disect"". No explanation, no other dialouges going after that. He for the past decade, of my research, is a continuous Kleptomaniac, Crashed my car as a Sober DD, and had quips of things that could've been violent against me.

I do not judge a person on the sins (not the religious sin) they sincerely wholeheartedly regret*, I judge the sins they continue to commit/newly start against others.

Today, I had a wonderful day, and the night was even better. Its been around 4 ish years since I have made any social contact with him. Have a Long Term Relationship, two furry four-legged cattos, and a neat apartment. I often stay up later than usual to *""philosophize""* current happenings, or to have an existential crisis. I usually do not get calls and prefer it so. I always manage to check texts is before responding. Sometimes I do fail at checking but it works out in that department in of itself. 

Then I get a text from him. I do not recognize the name and texted back immediately since it is possibly I lost contact with a friend. Usually, it works out like in a sequence of my friends saying ""lets ***do something***"" and I usually talk it over with my gf, and either go if the plans do not fit, or do go. *Usually* thats how it goes.

But after investigating who this guy is, it all clicked. He stated the usual ""its been a while"", and what now then statted commenting that im ""family"", and he ""loves"" me. Remember, only knew this guy for a few months before he got arrested. Then the bombardment of ""we have to hangout"", and ""we should do so soon"", etc. Then the weirdest red flag comes up: he wants my number. After a few minutes, he sent his. 

As of now, I am laying in bed typing this up, a few minutes after the exchange. I put myself in a corner accidentally, and effed up on not immediately recognizing his name. The big red notification is staring at me, along with uneasiness with a lot of caution.

Worked at a target in stocking. Finally moved up to register after a while. Thought, hey, it's easy to shoplift gift cards. However, I had to make it feasible. So, in the employee office we have a white board. New employees have an id number written on there. We need id numbers to clock in and login at register.

So, I registered another id from a different employee with a pass word I know. Logged in at register, scanned two gift cards for $500 each. After my shift decided to go shopping with it, at same target I worked at. Bought a Nintendo DS, Tales of Phantasia, Xbox 360 and a game for it, forgot which one. Next day, I go to work like nothing happened. 10 minutes in my shift they call me in the office and sit me down.

Showed me a video of me scanning the cards and later buying the stuff with it. Denied it, nope that's not me. Police standing right behind put me in cuffs and walked me through the store out the front, walk of shame. Took me to jail hold, dad walked in furious couple hours later, eyes red. 

Got a year probation, and kept the stuff. I was dumb and stupid at 17. Now I'm 35, safe to say, never did it again.

Second is that I am afraid my future self will look back at the things I wrote and cringe, be like "" ew how could I write this? Why did I write this? So embarrassing, if anyone saw this they'd say it's cringy, how could I've written something like this?"" This makes me really really scared and unmotivated to write. 
 Is there a way I can get over this? Something to do that will help me not think like that? I really wanna start sharing stuff but I also have this very big confidence and self esteem problem and I just think everything I make is really bad, which probably led to the above mentioned problems occuring.
 Any help is appreciated..!

A little background: I'm a pizza delivery driver, and once a month, this client orders like 100 small pizzas for their staff.

Mandates were lifted in my area last month,  but they held out a bit longer, so the last time I saw them, we still had to wear masks inside their facility. Today, there were no masks, and I meant to say it was nice to see their whole face, but it came out backwards. We laughed it off, but I'm genuinely embarrassed right now.

It was tough becuase she is quite open about previous relationships and would talk about them often, which hurt while having feeling for her. We ended up good friends but every now and then we would get drunk and sleep together but she would sometimes prompt after saying it didn’t mean anything and we were just friends 

Over the summer break she went back home and I started to have feeling for her again but was to afraid to talk to her about it. 

Fast forward till today, I’ve been sick with covid and have been isolating at home for over a week, and we call tonight, she was two bottles down on wine so quite drunk. We chat for a bit and I confess my feelings and she takes it really well, she appreciated that I thought well of her, she attractive, really comfortable to be around and really intelligent. She was flattered but very nicely said she didn’t feel the same way which was nice, reassuring me that I can gently let go over her. 

Cool that went well but then for what ever reason I want to be honest about how in my our times drinking together she would become quite flirty and would hit on guys regularly and would often share details about her many one night stands over the year, she started getting uncomfortable and said what’s your point, what are you trying to say. I started to feel like this was a bad idea but In my sick foggy haze I stupidly kept going and said something along the lines of “hypothetically speaking if we did get together Im not sure if you would be faithful” and proceed yo share an anicdote about how she was dared to take her pants of at a party and took a photo of her pants around her ankles and shared it in our uni group chat. 

As you can imagine she was speechless and abruptly ended the call and it struck me how much of an asshole I had just been i quickly messaged her saying I was really sorry and that what I had said was cruel. A few moments later she called back and swore at me and said she couldn’t believe what I had said and that it was sexist to assume when a woman does flirts she’s a slut, she said she didn’t want to talk to me for a while and I said I was sorry, at a loss of what to say and she hang up again. 

So now I feel like shit that I could treat a friend so horrible, I obviously will respect her wishes for space but also want to give a sincere apology.

Some of the friends needed to get picked up, so my friend(D)'s mom(M) agreed to pick them up as long as I paid for gas.

When they picked me up, D's little sister(N) was there. At some point during the ride, I dropped my phone between the seats. N tried to help me, but noticed her magnets where in the crease of the seat. N asked if I could grab the magnets, and wanting to be nice, I manged to grab the four tiny, pea sized magnets and handed them to N.

Cut to a few minutes later, we make it to one of my friend's house. When I go to get out, N wants to come with me. While waiting at this friends door, N. starts coughing. I asked N if she was okay and she proceeded to inform me that she put the magnets in her mouth because she had no pockets and had accidentally swallowed them. I quickly sent N to her mom, and that was the end of the situation other than her coughing the rest of the ride and apparently coughing up blood at one point, but she was fine. Or so I thought.

While at school today, D and I were discussing my birthday and D informed me of the rest of the story. N was taken to the doctor the day after the party. The doctor sent them to the ER, where they did an xray to figure out where the magnets were. Then the ER sent N&amp;M to the hospital to monitor the magnets. The magnets were fine, but they got stuck. N ended up needing surgery to get them out and they needed to remove her appendix as well.

So this litterally happened an hour ago and I'm lying on my bed writing this to make myself feel better.

So yesterday, a colleague reached out to me saying they had a cool game they've been making with a group of friends. Cool, I checked out his website to check if it's even real and told him i'd check it out later (it looked like a standard makeshift project, nothing extraordinary, kind of weird that it had it's own "".com"" website but whatever). He tried to persuade me to try it and let him know what I think about it but i was busy, so held it off for later.

Anyways, I forgot, and remembered this morning, so decided why not, I'll download it real quick and give it a try.

First, my Discord restarted, I foolishly thought that it was  just an ill-timed update since i just turned on my pc, WRONG.

***BZZZZZ***

-weird, this does seem fishy but maybe its just the monthl-

***BZZZZZ***

*""Your account has been charged with 9,99 for discord.inc*""

***BZZZZZ***

You get the gist of it. After 3 minutes of continuous ***BZZZZBZZZZBZZZZBZZZZBZZZZBZZZBZZZZBZZZZZBZZZZBZZZZBZZZZ*** I was in full blown panic mode, trying to disconnect all my payment methods from their account but my hands were shaking so much that it was difficult to even hit the right keys. Messaged everyone who might be in contact with the person that they are sending malicious software and to spread the warning, it was the only thing i could do at this point.

I got in contact with paypal and bank people so hopefully this will sort itself out pretty soon. Lost a couple hundred $ before the automatic system locked down my debit cards.

My hands are still shaking.

So I walk into calculus. We had a substitute that day because our teacher had Covid - she was a nice old lady. Usually, the substitutes are given 2015-ish MacBook Pros to use while they teach. This particular specimen had seen better days; so I saw as my eye followed the HDMI cable from the projector to the laptop, it had grown a belly. The trackpad and keyboard were bulging up - the battery had expanded a LOT...

At this point everyone was still getting ready, the sub was taking attendance, and I went ""oh nooo..."" under my breath. I stood up and blurted, ""This is literally a bomb. this computer is a certifiable bomb."" I regained my sanity and said something to the effect of, ""The battery has expanded, it's bulging against the frame. These can explode, you should get IT to give you a different computer."" So the sub gets on the phone with ""IT"" which was really another teacher (we'll call him Mr. M) who had been providing the laptops. At this point everyone in the class is either silent or laughing at me with variations on ""it's a bomb!! uhauahaha""

Sub (incredulously): So there's a student in my class here who says my computer's a bomb, that it's going to **explode**.

**Me,** desperately trying to regain my dignity: The battery's expanded-

**Sub**: She says the battery's expanded and you should come and replace it.

(Side note: I'm a dude lol. I have a man bun so old lady thought I was a girl)

So now Mr. M comes in and I explain it to him, he replaces the laptop, the zoom is all sorted out, etc etc. I realized though, looking at the new laptop, that its battery had expanded too. what. I have so many questions. Mental note to talk to Mr. M later and get him to return the explosive stash to IT...

I run into him a few hours later during passing period,

**Mr. M**: Thanks for letting me know about the computer. I brought that one right back to IT. 

**Me**: No problem, sorry about that. Do you have more of these which have expanded batteries?

**Mr. M**: Not that I know of.

**Me**: Ok, actually also the one you gave the sub also had a bad battery, uh..

**Mr. M**: Should I go and replace that one too?

**Me**: Yeah probably. (I proceed to explain to him the dangers of expanded batteries)

**Mr. M**: Thanks for letting me know. I'll go and replace the other one.

**Me**: Alrighty bye :)

*A Lithe Hope*— An unexpected name for a rocket ship, but it was the one Alden Connors settled on. It should be called “A Ragged Hope” now, but Alden wouldn’t besmirch his cosmic slagged beauty with a cosmetic touch up— she was beautiful the way she was. Alden had survived thirty seven skirmishes, eight ambushes, and two galactic wars. He followed the rules passed down to him from his grandfather after his time in the Crimson Legion. 

1) Never turn your back on Deep Space.

2) Your first mate is your best hope.

3) Don’t die with any ammo left. 

Alden hadn’t had to test the third one yet, but he hoped he’d get another run at the Chavirari tentacle tank before that happened. He had four million galactic chits to win back. He stilled owed his first mate, Suhel, for the Vinaldi race that put him in the hole in the first place. Alden knew he shouldn’t bet against a crewman— even Suhel. But he couldn’t ignore the feeling he had in his gut— turned out to be the rancid Tengiri flakes in his rice. 

The most recent job took Alden and *A Lithe Hope* into Grenden territory. Long known as the gnolls of the dark spots of space, the Grenden cannibalized any craft they managed to hunt own. Alden knew of an old federation pilot that survived a Grenden raid by hiding in the water tanks before being jettisoned to the closest planet— thankfully he was returning from a space op— so he was still suited up. He claimed the Grenden spoke a language not found in the galactic codex. He tried to record it— but his translator and recorder were damaged in his initial escape. Alden wasn’t sure if the account held water, but he knew it couldn’t be ignored. If the Grenden were capable of hiding an entire language from the federation— what else were they capable of? Alden worried about the settlements on the outer rims— they wouldn’t find salvation— even if they managed to fire their beacons. The federation would never reach them in time— not for the threat a secretly coordinated Grenden posed. 

Alden’s sister still lived on one of Farrix’s moons. Her small family was embedded with the local militia that replled the Voron threat after the lax Grenden years. Lia was tougher than Alden— he knew she’d be fine. He still fidgeted with his family signet ring when he thought of her though. She was the only one left after their grandfather passed away. He still wondered why she let him take the ship. It was her birthright— but she passed it over to him and he never looked back. After he realized no one was tracking his movements— Alden drifted off the galactic map and found the pockets of space dust and mischief he was searching for. 

Now, he found himself short of credits and full of experience— which meant another trip to Jago’s boards. Long reputed as the least trustworthy man in the galaxy— Jago Ventura owned the trading rights to seven galatic ports. Running a job for Jago meant violence and delays— but the man paid in full. And even worse, his daughter was Alden’s favorite midnight wish amongst the stars. Vox forbid Jago learn about him and Mayte. He only had one starship and couldn’t afford to have it destroyed by a blackmarket kingpin.",False,shortstories,t5_2qhmi,self,[SF] Dark Corner of Hope,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/tmu1ce/sf_dark_corner_of_hope/,2022,3,0.0,,,,,

So I feel kinda embarrassed even asking this, but for those who use writing prompt books (especially those with very little space to write after the prompt), how do you make the most of them?

Background information: I'm trying to get back into writing as a hobby. I enjoyed it tremendously from middle school through early college, but as I switched from a journalism/English major to the medical field my writing had to become more technical and bland. Life happens of course, and even though I've told myself for years I can do both, I never have.

Recently, I've really been feeling the itch. My ADHD brain talked myself into buying a writing prompt book on a whim yesterday (if you know, you know) thinking that it may help kickstart my love again.

Well after buying it, I've realized that with 5 prompts a page there's barely room to really write about the prompt (I actually did look through it first and for some reason at the time it didn't register, ADHD). Writing it someplace else seems to defeat the point. I could return it without issue, but I am drawn to the convenience of having something I can take with me and work on if I have some downtime and the urge strikes.

So, has anyone used a book like this? If so, how did you make it work for you? Maybe a two sentence story scenario?

I've seen r/writingprompts and am eager to try out some of those, but I think I'll save those for times where I know I can work on them for a longer period.

I've only just recently realized how bad it could've been. And yes, as an adult, I realize how idiotic this entire situation was.

When I first got to high school, some friends and I would get together after class and have a kind of fight club in a the flat part of a giant stairwell. The only rules were no face or nut punches, no punches if someone's down. The floor was concrete. Yes. Idiotic.

So one day, some other student we didn't know asked to join us. We didn't know each other but anyone who's been in this situation knows it's weirdly a great bonding experience for men. But this guy wouldn't tap. I hit him pretty hard in the arm and we had to stop. We shook hands, I really thought everything was ok. We even took the same bus going home and talked during the trip. I guess losing really got to this guy's head cause he came to school with a knife and belt the next day.

I was walking into school and he was waiting for me. He came up behind me and put the belt around my neck and tried to tighten it. I guess he didn't anticipate how much he'd be fumbling with a knife trying to pull it out while actively fighting a guy. I just pulled it off me and he ran.

Now *this* is where my fuck up happens. I wasn't going to report him. Some back story: I'm from a place of lawlessness. I grew up in a corrupt place where calling any government official meant more trouble for everyone involved. I carried this belief when I moved to North America. My stupid kid logic was ""He tried to kill me, so it's only fair that I kill him after school."" I don't know how I was this stupid. I almost messed up my entire future just to get even with some low life. 

Some girls from my class saw and reported it to the principal. My dumb ass even tried to lie that it was nothing so I could get him myself. Wasn't very convincing with a giant red streak going around my neck. Kid got expelled. Apparently he had a bunch of previous suspensions. He came back during the last year of high school saying he went to therapy and his parents divorce messed him up. His positive changes lasted a few months at most until he was back to attacking people. Turns out you can't force rehabilitation on people. Court ordered therapy is a joke.

Id like to be an author to bring the things that are in my head out on paper to a fully fetched book or something similar. The problem i have is that if i try it on my own i start all enthusiastically and then as soon as things get complicated or are beyond the things i have already in my mind, i loose interest again for a bit until the circle continues. 
I have tried to work with tutorials, with books, with worldbuilding tools. It all just lead to some rudimentary things.
The main issue i have is that im lacking basically a full Story. I have themes, scenes, some characters, but sadly no arc yet that puts them all together and makes it possible for me to make a story or multiple out of the patches of content i have so far.
My question would be if there is a Forum or something where i can find people who are more knowledgeable than me, to just talk about the things in head, and with the right questions and nudges find my story.

However, if one were to assign a second descriptor to it, they might choose eclectic. For it borrowed from a seemingly endless array of architectural schools that seemed to result in pure chaos, but that was only when you looked upon it from afar. Upon closer inspection, the various styles and schools created a sort of interlocking pattern that morphed and changed even as you examined it. The strangely beautiful result of this seemingly random mixing of architectural styles had ended up being widely hailed as the pinnacle of human aestheticism.

Its interior was no different, the wildly varying styles bled into each other, and one could become lost in the rapturous beauty of the maze-like corridors of the castle. In fact, more than one individual had done just that, though regular patrols from the devout guardsmen of the Palace kept anyone from becoming permanently lost.

In the throne room of the Palace, the Queen was currently receiving petitioners. The dizzyingly high columns supported a ceiling that arched far above the court. Dozens of humans milled on the sidelines, some required to attend, bound by their duties. Others merely sought to entertain themselves and viewed the petitioning as a distraction from the daily grind of their various obligations. They tittered amongst themselves from behind their stone and metal masks as the next petitioner kneeled and began to speak.

“Your majesty, I greet you oh most luminous Queen of Luna. I come before you today to prey upon your generosity. My people, the Cathrundi are currently suffering at the hand of the Letraxin, they have invaded our worlds. I fear that we will not be able to repel them with our own meager power and so I have been sent to beseech your aid. That you have deigned to hear my request at all honors not only myself, but my kin as well.”

The man who spoke wasn’t really a man, at least not a human man. His species shared humanity’s sexual dimorphism, and it even manifested similarly. However, beyond that they weren’t terribly similar. His species was far larger than humans and bore their children in a way more similar to marsupials than humans. They also found the extremely high oxygen levels that humanity preferred somewhat toxic. They could survive for a few days in such an environment, but after that they would begin to suffer severe side effects.

This aversion to human atmosphere excused the exo-suit he wore as he presented himself to the Queen. Though for his speech, he had removed his helmet in a show of respect for the Queen as he bowed deeply on the first four of his six legs. His head, like the rest of his body, was scaly, lending him a reptilian look, though the shape of his head, as well as the unmistakable beak, was more birdlike than anything.

He remained in that pose for long seconds after he delivered his request for aid. He knew he was lucky to even receive an audience with the Queen of Luna. She was extremely busy, and the sheer quantity of sapient beings seeking to petition her far outweighed the amount she could ever possibly receive. He’d had no choice but to try his luck as all other official attempts to gather allies to aid in his people’s fight against the Letraxin had failed miserably. This was his people’s last hope for salvation. If the Queen did not grant them succor, then they would be trampled by the endless legions of the Letraxin, and those who survived the invasion would be taken as slaves to serve their new masters.

“You have been heard, Decqual, descendant of Norperien and representative of the Cathrundi. You may rise.” The Queen of Luna spoke in a clear, measured tone. Her voice was like the sound of distant church bells echoing across a dewy meadow. Just hearing her voice was pure delight for the vast majority of sapient species, and Decqual was no exception. He was just barely able to maintain a somber facial expression as he rose to face the Queen, though it was an immense struggle as his heart lit with joy upon hearing her speak.

He faced her, she was small, even for a human. Her skin was slightly transparent, proudly displaying her slight musculature and the gently pulsing veins that ran along her arms. Her face was hidden by a heavily stylized silver mask that covered even her eyes, though he knew that she could quite clearly see him in spite of it. Her pale blue dress nearly rose to meet the mask, leaving on the barest amount of her neck exposed as it flowed like water to pool at her feet, the silvery-white accents serving to make it seem as if she was actually garbed in water. Decal stood and faced her, maintaining eye contact with the mask as was traditional in the Queen’s Court when she asked that you rise.

“Your people are new to the galaxy I believe. I remember when we first heard of your kind establishing a colony some four centuries ago. We foresaw then that you might become easy targets and warned you to prepare for the coming storm, and yet that was not enough. Why have you failed to prepare to protect yourselves? Why are you so *weak*?” The Queen’s words were scathing, and Decqual could not help but flinch as she questioned his people’s inadequacies.

“Your majesty,” he began selecting his words carefully. “Your words did not go unheeded, and we did prepare for others to encroach upon what we claimed. However our people are not so long-lived as yours and as generations passed so did our vigilance. Our philosophers called for a more peaceful reign claiming that by clinging to violence we only lowered ourselves and that true enlightenment could only be achieved through pacifism. The shifting tides of culture through the flow of time has weakened us and now we pay the price for it most dearly. I can provide no good excuse for our failures as a species only this explanation of our folly and shortsightedness. I humbly beg your forgiveness in spite of that.”

Decqual’s answer drew chuckles from the surrounding courtiers. Their faces were hidden behind a variety of masks that varied not only in style but material composition. However, very few were of silver, for only those of royal blood were allowed to wear silver masks, and successors to the throne rarely lived very long. He noted that not a single laugh left the throat of those with silver masks that he was able to notice. He wondered at that and its potential significance, but his thoughts were interrupted when the Queen delicately cleared her throat, silencing the laughter echoing in the courtroom.

“Such failures are difficult for me to overlook. However, I can understand why a species so young and short-lived might be equally short-sighted. These were traits that even we humans once held in ages long past. Though we have grown beyond our original constraints, it is wise to remember we were not always gods striding above the mortals with whom we share this galaxy.” Her speech seemed to be an admonishment to those who had laughed at Decqual, and he felt a mote of relief. If nothing else, she was understanding, though it was unclear if that would translate to her bequeathing aid to his cause.

The Queen paused for several long moments, and the courtroom and its occupants waited silently for her next words. “That being said, to cast aside your ability and will to commit violence is akin to casting aside your right to live. Tell me, why should I assist a species that has willingly thrown itself off a cliff? Why should I help those who seek to help themselves to their deaths?”

Decal considered her question. She was right of course, that they had brought this upon themselves. By casting aside violence, they had brought death upon themselves. He could not and would not deny anything she had stated. How to answer her then? What reason could he possibly give to the Queen of Luna that would satisfy her? He himself had called for the re-establishment of his people’s military in these past years, and yet he and others like him had gone ignored up until now when it was already too late. It was truly hard to see how his species deserved redemption when cast under the judging light of Luna.

But perhaps he could use that light to his advantage, for that light was currently cast upon him, and it was *his* words and actions that bore weight here in this courtroom. And he was one of the few Cathrundi who was proud to carry on the ancient ways of war, if only in mimicry. He straightened his back and placed his helmet upon his head, the seal clicking shut. “I have no words that might prove that my people deserve to be saved. I shall instead show you through action that we yet deserve to live.”

The guards by the throne tensed as his words, but he had already begun to move by the time they realized his intent. The Queen gazed upon him unmoving even as he lunged towards her, her mask as impassive as ever as blades unfolded from the arms of his exo-suit. He had surrendered his pulse cannon upon entering the Palace. It was a relic passed down through his family line but still a good weapon. He missed it sorely now as the blades of his exo-suit came down upon the shield of one of the guards.

The other guard used the opportunity to lunge forward with his spear, but Decqual was too quick and jumped backward, just barely avoiding the blow. His suit was armored, but human material sciences were millennia beyond anything his people knew, and he did not trust his suit’s armor to hold up against human weaponry. He was glad that the guards had yet to reach for the pistols upon their hips, for if they did, the fight would be over in no time at all.

He lunged forward again, both of the guards held up their shields, spears poking forth from behind them. He bounced to the side as he edged towards the spears using the light gravity to launch himself into a spiral. The guard closest to him must have realized what he was doing and, in a quick motion swung his shield, throwing it into Decquals path. A quick burst of his suit’s thrusters corrected his course away from both the shield and the Queen. At this point, many of the courtiers had fled to the corners of the room farthest from her majesty, which suited Decqual just fine as it gave him more room to maneuver.

He decided that to truly prove his point, he would have to stop dancing about, and as he landed, he launched himself forward straight at the guards. One of them launched just as he did and was caught by surprise. Decquals left blade struck him squarely in his chest and sent him flying upwards. Decal slowed on the impact, unfortunately allowing the other guard to score a blow on him tearing through his armor just as easily as Decqual had previously feared.

The Queen’s voice rang out as the guard’s spear withdrew and prepared for a second blow, “Enough, you have proven your point representative of the Cathrundi.” With that proclamation Decqual’s blades retreated and the guards resumed their postings at either side of the throne, though their expressions betrayed a continued wariness of Decqual. 

“I beg your forgiveness your majesty. I could think of no other way to prove that we Cathrundi are not beyond redemption. The desire to fight, to live, it still burns bright in us. I do not come here to beg that we be saved, only that we be given the chance to fight back.” Decal hoped that this last impassioned plea would work.

He was rewarded with laughter from the Queen as she bent over in her throne, clutching her stomach. Her normally gentle and restrained voice had been overcome by a raucous belly laugh that disconcerted everyone in the room. The Queen regained her composure after a few moments and stood up from her throne, “Your answer is filled with vigor and passion, I find your desire to rail against the cultural constraints of your people, and the universe that seeks to destroy you…amusing. I shall grant you your desire. You shall be granted weaponry commesnsurate with your people’s technological prowess. It will, however, be up to your people to use those weapons to save themselves. Do not waste this gift, for if you do I will ensure your extinction in return for wasting my goodwill.”

“Your generosity knows no bounds Queen of Luna, with this proclamation I shall leave your presence and return to my people with the material you have so graciously bequeathed unto us. We will not forget this kindness in the long years to come.” Decqual gave a final bow to The Queen and was escorted from the hall. 

From there, everything became a blur as he was presented with a veritable river of documentation to sign. He signed it all without bothering to read the documents. It didn’t matter either way if any of the legalese in the documents was not in his people’s favor. Without this aid they would die regardless. So he signed everything that was put in front of him, eventually plowing through it all. After that particular ordeal, he was guided back to his ship.

The captain of his ship had already docked inside the hangar of a truly massive human cargo vessel. The ship was still being loaded when he approached. Crates upon crates of weapons and armor for infantry were being loaded alongside long-range fighter craft and other vehicles of war. The vessel was larger than even his people’s largest space stations, and it was being filled to the brim with weaponry. His heart flowed over with joy at the sight. Many would fight and die so that they might survive, but for the first time since the invasion had started, there was hope that they might survive the coming days.",False,shortstories,t5_2qhmi,self,[SF] An Audience With The Queen of Luna,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/tn2auv/sf_an_audience_with_the_queen_of_luna/,2022,3,0.0,,,,,

the span of maybe 2 or so years, Today i realized that it was all because of me

Just to let you know i am only 14 in the 8th grade, My friend is about a month or so older than me, But we were friends for a long time, Ever since i can remember, We lived in an apartment complex,he Y ad in
the first floor and i lived right above him. Anyway This all started at the beginning of covid, Since we lived in the same building we got to hang out a lot, id go to his house and he'd come to mine. Around that time he
became friends with someone who had moved towards the end of the year, Let's call him ""M"" Him and M started to hang out a lot by the time it was summer, And
by the beginning of the next school year they were like close friends.Anyway One time when we were walking back home, Both me,G,and U said to eachother (after
seeing someone smoking) That any of us who smoke are the r-slur,

Anyways fast forward to the end of the school year, me and G walked home, While we were walking back home U and his other friends (which are skaters) decided to
skate past us, In which i tried out U's board,Then G got interested aswell and decided to try it out, On our way home he asked me several questions about skating and i answered with what i knew. The Very next day, He bought his own skateboard Now this is what starts his downfall. In the group of skaters there's a kid called T,T
is a ""gangster"" troublemaker type of kid,Hangs around ""hard"" people,smokes, does drugs and all that, Me and T are cool,But he since he skates,Whenever G hung around the other skaters,T would also be there, I believe this is where G might've wanted to start, but he hadn't yet. In maybe like late June, early july. My other friend
Th was dating G,But aroudn that time G hung out with B,and A. They all smoked, The only reason i believe they hung out is because, Z found G attractuve after he
had grown out his hair (a very popular thing the skaters in my town do) and A was his friend aswell, which was friends with M. During the hangout G smoked for the
first time ever, it wasn't a cart or anything but actual weed. They began hanging out more and more, until the group split and G began hanging out with M,And T.
During the summer G broke up with Th because he might've been interested in Z.
Towards october or november G met E,Which Th wasn't a fan of,Starting the dumb drama going on in between
the friend groups. E and G,Along with her friends,we're all against Me,Th,S,B (from the previous friend group), Al,and Ever since that one hangout,G has done more
than weed, Acid,And has gotten in trouble with the cops multiple times.
I feel guilt to know that if i hadn't suggested we walk home this wouldn't have happened, because G was very into video games,If he hadn't discovered skating he wouldn't have skated all of summer but rather play games and would've stayed how he was then. Me and G aren't as close anymore and we don't even talk to each other. It might seem dumb and i might get hate comments because of my age, But if G continues how he is now, there is no doubt he will be like this in the
coming years, In 2 months it'll be a year since i made the dumb choice of asking to walk home and i still feel ashamed.

I'm in a building with thin walls. Very thin walls. Thankfully everyone here is completely silent almost all of the time, which made this night much worse. I (M20s) invited a girl over (I'll call D) and her friend (J). The plan was to let them try out my VR setup.... With a horror game.

That was the biggest mistake ever. Unbeknownst to me, D is a screamer. A very loud screamer. So first I have a go on the headset, show them how it works and then I immediately hand it off to D.  She starts playing and first things are fine, but her stress levels are rising. With every passing second she gets more and more tense. On the first jump scare she screams and I jump because I wasn't expecting it. Thankfully it was short, maybe my neighbours wouldn't notice?

30 seconds later, she screams again. This one both louder and longer. All I can think is ""Oh God, people are going to think I'm murdering a girl in my room.""

Then the worst possible thing happens. She's had enough but can't take the headset off, so she yells ""Please I don't want to do this, I WANT TO STOP"" then lets out a scream like a banshee.  So now I don't sound like I'm killing a girl, I now sound like I'm raping one! Christ this can't get any worse! 

She takes off the headset and there's a banging at my door. I'm pretty much terrified at this point, I know how it sounds. D opens the door and I literally hide behind it in shame. On the other side is not one, not two, but three girls from my hall (who all know me). I'm still grateful J was there and D was still holding the headset when she opened the door, because my neighbours were quickly satisfied that I wasn't committing a crime. Took a while before I could look them in the eye again though.

TL;DR: 

Let a girl try out my VR headset, she made it sound like I was raping her and got the attention of 3 neighbouring girls.

I didn't notice at that moment (probably because all the adrenaline coursing through my veins), but my hand was blue and swelling. While I was above the guy, his girlfriend/babymomma came from behind and bent over him.

She asked me if I wanted to press charges, I just answered: ""what for? I won."" Hours later and I'm in the ER getting my hand X-rayed and wondering if it was the right decision to let him go free...

This happened about ten years ago, when I was in my early 20s working at a music store. This music store specialized in buying and selling used instruments and gear. One Saturday, a guy in his early to mid 40s pulled up with a vanload of PA equipment he was looking to sell. It was mostly inexpensive, off-brand speakers a power amp, and other odds and ends (stands, microphones, a mixer, etc.). He explained that he planned on selling and upgrading the gear for his sons band. ""Great"", I thought, maybe I could get a nice sale out of this. After I researched the value of his gear, I pitched him a number for everything and he agreed on it. I explain to him I have to test everything and make sure it works before I can cut him a check or do a trade in. He agrees and tells me to test everything out and he'll be back shortly. I explain it will only take a few minutes if he wants to hang out and wait while I'm testing everything. But he says that he wanted to go buy the upgraded gear at our competitors store (rhymes with Sitar Renter). This kind of bugged me because I was hoping to get a sale out of this, but oh well, he can buy the gear where ever he wants. So anyway he leaves and I start testing out his gear. I hook up the power amp to the speakers and begin playing music through it, something I have done hundreds of times. At first, everything was going smoothly, but out of nowhere I hear a loud crackle and then a pop and then nothing but a harsh, distorted sound coming from the speakers. My take on it was the speaker was blown. Keep in mind, I wasn't pushing the amp or the speakers to hard, but for whatever reason the speaker blew. A little later, the guy comes back with all new, name brand gear from our competitor. I explain to him that we cannot buy his gear, because it is broken. This sets him off. He started getting in my face and yelling at me and demands to see my manager. The owner of the store ended up coming out, telling him exactly what I told him, and then went back into his office. This guy kept getting extremely confrontational with me, and getting right in my face. I kept backing up but he would just continue to step up to my face. Before he left, he decided he still wanted paid for the rest of the gear he was selling, so we agreed. We wrote him a check and as he was leaving he pointed to me and said ""Fuck you very much"", then to my co-worker ""fuck you very much"" and lastly to the owner ""and fuck you very much"".",False,TalesFromRetail,t5_2t2zt,self,Tales From a Music Store,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromRetail/comments/tk7jrk/tales_from_a_music_store/,2022,3,0.0,,,,,

When 2021 rolled around though, it brought with it two separate Covid infections in a two month span. Don’t ask me how I managed to catch it twice, I guess I’m just a super-catcher. After that, my brain’s productivity capabilities fell to somewhere between my pre-medicated state and my post-medicated state. It was frustrating, but I managed—

Until Covid round 3.

I caught it again last week and it’s been rough. The worst of it is in my head. I’ve struggled to get down more than a paragraph or two anytime I set out to write something. My brain doesn’t feel the way it does without medication, but the results of my work are basically the same. I have a plan, I know what’s supposed to happen in the story, but my brain just doesn’t have an output once I sit down to write it out. It’s like trying to suction water out of a cement-clogged pipe. 

I’m sure there are others who’ve dealt with this; have any of you found ways to combat it or fix it? I just want my brain to be back in its normal state so that I can write properly again.",False,writing,t5_2qh2n,self,Writing with the Covid brain,https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/xsyq32/writing_with_the_covid_brain/,2022,10,0.0,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

It never fails.

Ticket title: Labtop    \[SIC\]

Ticket body: &lt;Empty&gt;

Do you need one for your work?

Do you have one and it is broken?

Did it get stolen?

What, exactly, is it you think I or anyone can do with this level of missing information?

&amp;#x200B;

That's just the beginning.

Next they submit a ticket which at least sounds like an issue, but fail to provide any usable info.

I'll directly ask them:

1 What is the computer name?

2 Please screenshot the issue and don't crop out valuable contextual info

3 (something targeted to see if it is something we might have going on or be aware of)

And they answer 1 question only. ONE. And incorrectly often, too, giving wrong computer name.

&amp;#x200B;

So then I tell them, it appears you're missing some info here. Please submit the remaining requested information.

You know, treat them like a responsible adult.

And they, I kid you not, either answer only one additional question, half ass it so that answer is barely usable, or say stuff like what questions? Or ask you to drop what you are doing and call them, when you have 30 other people who are cooperating while they are not, effectively pushing themselves back of the line.

&amp;#x200B;

Or how about the ones who play ""Games"" with the Waiting for customer status, who keep replying with useless/irrevolent things just so it's not waiting for customer, wasting my time because I have to keep managing their ticket and re-asking questions.

&amp;#x200B;

Then on admin requests, I'll ask them specific targeted questions about the need based on what they submitted.

And they reply with one word or incomplete answers.

I had one the other day I had to ask 3 times the same question, guy kept changing subject, going off on tangent, refused to answer basic questions necessary to vet the request.

Literally there was nothing I could do for him.

&amp;#x200B;

These are fully grown adults, who work for a well known company you have to have ""something"" going for you to get hired at. It isn't language issues. Nothing being asked is technical.

If they can't answer 1, or 1 2 3, how do they deal with stuff like the DMV, school, voting, 401k, finances, etc., all of which is infinitely more complex?

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't get it.

It's like they are trying to make my life hell.

&amp;#x200B;

Running off to hide in a fetal position now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the replies, never knew so many others had the same experience. Even the guy who isn't in IT!  Can't imagine doing like maintenance, where you may not be at your computer as often as you'd like, and having to deal with this. I guess it's just universal, people are bad at communicating. Makes me feel a little better at least!

I work in an ultra high volume environment and with enough tickets we often begin to see trends and identify issues before our sysadmins notice. So getting decent info fast is important. I am often juggling 20, 30, even 60 issues from unique customers at a time and have a high close and satisfaction rating.

I experiment with responses to see what seems to work best. Unfortunately I have not found a way to get people to take their own tickets seriously enough to answer 2-3 easy non technical questions 100% of the time. When this happens and we have people cooperating and others not, they only deny themselves a fast resolve. 

Above is actually concerning to me, despite the joking/rant, as there may be some legit hot items which then take longer to be identified. In this case, a worker is not just hurting themselves, they may be hurting company efforts.

We get those people who submit a ticket and are never available, or who submit and then go on vacation or home for the day. I'll never get that. In my years at where I have been we have a high same day initial contact and close rate yet they act as if they can't get support. 

There are some ideas in this thread, I plan to make another pass to go through it to see if I can try some new things. Thank you.

Always lurking in the shadows just out of sight, on the fringes of perception, behind the thin fragile veil of happiness and contentment, just waiting to pounce.  
 

When it strikes, and it always will, it will deal a devastating blow that completely blindsides you. The shock of the attack isn’t the worst part. The worst part is that once is gets a hold of you, it won’t let go. It grabs you and draws you into it’s cold embrace.   
 

It swallows you whole, encompassing your entire being in a thick shroud of suffering and torment. You feel as if you’re choking on every breath you take as your lungs fill with cement. It’s like drowning in an endless sea as your insides kick and scream for sweet release as you struggle to keep afloat.   
 

Your body will wither, and your mind will break. Small fragments of what made you the person you are begin to slowly fade into nothing, and you won’t care. A numbness sets in as the world seems to deaden around you, leaving you isolated and alone, left with nothing but the perversions of your deluded and shattered psyche as you become a prisoner of your own thoughts.   
 

On the surface, for short moments, you can steal the thinnest sliver of happiness but that won’t do to sustain you. Any nourishment you would have gained is immediately sapped as depression rears it's ugly head and comes back for more.   
 

It is a cruel master that is not easily slighted and is not to be taken lightly. It is a monster, and it will ravage you and there is little to be done to stop it. It cannot be destroyed, it cannot be beaten, bent, or broken, there is no silver bullet to quickly end its reign of terror.  
 

That, we cannot have.  
 

All may seem at a loss with such powerful emotions and terrifying an adversary, but it is all a front. A great shadow cast on the wall that instils fear but cannot itself lay a finger on you. There is hope in defeating such a monster of the mind.  
 

In the face of all this, whether the threat be as daunting as perceived or merely an exaggerated reflection of it’s true nature, the fact still remains that it is a beast to be reckoned with. The journey will be long, and it will be tough, there will be days where it would feel easier to lay down and submit, and there will be days when the iron grip slackens enough that you may breathe freely. As hard as it may sound, an impossibility perhaps, but the Herculean task of besting this demon is better done a day at a time. Piece by piece you must learn to accept it for what it is.   
 

A part of you.   
 

It is a part of you no matter what you do and to overcome it is to accept it. There will never be a day where you may hold hands with the monster, allying with it is not a healthy practice, and neither is ignoring it. There are many paths to take on this journey, some more difficult than others, paved with varying challenges unique to us that may seem daunting at a first glace. The first step is understanding what it is that makes you feel this way and then, only then, can you get a proper foothold and begin to scale this monument. Then it’s possible to work on taking the thoughts and feelings at face value and seeing them for what they are, just thoughts and feelings that no longer dictate your actions and control you. You control them. You will always feel them and they will be powerful but that doesn’t mean there is anything wrong with you, it doesn’t mean you are beyond saving, and it doesn’t mean you have to suffer. You don’t have to buy into it’s lies anymore. You can shake off the shackles and not let it stand over you any longer. You don’t have to bend to it’s will, in time it will bend to yours.  
 

You can do this.   
 

We can do this. Together.

We're flirting and doing little touches and things to each other in the car.  He turns me on just talkimg to him, and he definitely got my panties wet with his little touches to my thighs and such. 

To the TIFU:

Truck ended up being shit so he brought me home as we rode together. I sit on my bed, we fire up a quick bowl, and then he leaves for work. I walk him out. I got to the bathroom,  wipe,  and realize I'm BLOODY as fuck down there,  not wet. I clean up, and run to my room. Lo and behold.... a fucking red spot on my sheets. And I hadn't been sitting there but 10 minutes. Then it dawned on me. If it were that obvious on my dark gray sheets in that short time frame.....

Ran to my phone to call him. He didn't answer. He's on his way to pick up his work pal to go do an estimate.  Poor guy is gonna show up with my period blood on his pants cause I KNOW I bled through onto his light gray fabric seat. Good thing the car is his work junk off vehicle... but still. I feel horrible. And so embarrassed I could shit... but I've already done enough. 

tl:dr: forgot about being on the rag, left my uterine lining on my crushes fabric seat just to have a stranger sit on it. Stab me please.

Update: he said, ""seats fine no worries... though it would've been funny to tell my buddy he should change his tampon!"" Good dude all around.

So I flushed the toilet and cut off the water supply and filled the bowl with bleach up to the point that it wouldn’t flush and went out to wait for a bit.

Waited far too long scrolling on my phone unknowingly went for a piss. Now I was about to let the flow become turbulent and I realized the foam that started to come up as soon as the piss hit the bowl full of bleach. Being in the military I was thought this exact scenario when training about ship safety and immediately forcibly shut off the pipe as I tried to open the door and run. I didn’t know how much I had inhaled or what the consequence of my urination would be so immediate I ran around the house looking for my issued respirator with my duck in my hand and pee leaking.

We talked and laughed a lot but since she didn't go to my school and wasn't living in the same city we didn't met a lot and WhatsApp and stuff like that wasn't a thing back then. The last time I saw her back then I just told her that I love her but her parents where coming so we couldn't talk about it and I'm not even sure if she knew I was serious about it. This was in summer and I didn't saw her after that. (winter came, we met randomly in a public pool since it was the only one in the area)

So many years later and I still have a crush on her tbh. Made a profile on a dating app some time ago but never really used it. Today I decided to check on it and who's on there liking my profile? That girl. I couldn't believe it and immediately checked her profile and well, it is not active anymore. Really wish I would've checked it sooner.

Yesterday, my wife (36) and daughter (13) tested positive for covid and are banished to one or both of their bedrooms. My oldest son (18) never leaves his room because video games = life, but has also been feeling pretty shitty despite a negative test result, though he has already had covid once. This leaves my youngest son (6) and me (35m) being the only ones in the house to feel fine, test negative, and have never contracted the virus and thusly have free reign of the rest of the house. As any decent father/husband would do, I sent them all a group text explaining that if this was a zombie virus, they would all be dead and 6yo and I would be our family's sole survivors and have to find a way to carry on without them. They laughed, called me an asshole and asked when dinner would be done and so I begin preparing the meal.

The scene is set.

I love corned beef. Not just for St. Patrick's Day, but all year. My wife does not love corned beef. She does not like it or even tolerate it. Mostly. 2 nights ago I spent several hours preparing a corned beef because we had planned to make corned beef hash for dinner last night. My wife will only eat corned beef if it's my homemade corned beef hash. Regardless of everyone's sick status, I continued to prepare corned beef hash for dinner.

6yo is in the kitchen with me as I gather the onion, garlic, butter, potatoes, etc. He is quite helpful and especially loves helping in the kitchen. As we finish up our dicing and prep work I go the the fridge and grab the corned beef that was prepared the night before, (boiled twice, slow roasted at low temp, tender, delicious, wrapped in foil), place it on the counter and ask 6yo if he was excited for dinner. He asks, ""What are we having again?"" forgetting what it's called. To which I reply excitedly ""CORNED BEEF HASH"" and smack the wrapped meat with my hand. 

I did not smack this chunk of protein with my dominant hand, but as luck would have it, I did smack it with the hand that has my Fitbit secured around the wrist. At the exact moment I assaulted the roast my Fitbit begins violently vibrating to alert me that I have reached my step goal for the day. I remark, ""Cool. Apparently that got me my final steps for the day."" 6yo asks, ""What did? Slapping the beef?"" I suppress a chuckle and reply with a simple, ""Yes"" thinking that would be the end of it. Nope. Wrong 

6yo proceeds to tell me I need to slap the beef every day to make sure I meet my step goal. Then he tells me that he wants a Fitbit so he can slap the beef and meet his step goals. After this he runs at a full sprint down the back hall towards, but not into, my room, currently housing my wife and daughter, and tells the two of them that dad got his step count by slapping the beef and he's going to get a Fitbit so he can slap the beef and both of us are going to slap the beef every day to make sure that we get our steps in and meet our goals.

I head down the hall towards him. I hear my wife and daughter laughing hysterically. I kneel down, look him in the eye and tell him in as normal of a tone as I can manage, ""That's a secret men have kept from women for thousands of years. You're not supposed to tell them that. It's for men only."" and I wink. His face lights up. He loves secrets. Who doesn't? He proceeds to tell his mom and sister to forget what they heard. He tells them that they know nothing. Lastly he informs them that we will slap the beef when they aren't around. Then I took off my Fitbit and made a delicious meal.

TL;DR: Smacked a piece of meat in front of my son which unintentionally earned my step goal on my fitbit. Son proceeded to tell his mom and sister that he and I were going to slap the beef every day to make sure we reach our Fitbit goals.",False,tifu,t5_2to41,self,"TIFU by ""slapping the beef"" in front of my 6yo",https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/tmph5e/tifu_by_slapping_the_beef_in_front_of_my_6yo/,2022,3,0.0,,,,,

""Man behind the possum"" here with a much less awesome story.... And aside from the occasional accidental nudity that somehow comes with the job, or this answering the door with a FULL ON erection.... I've never even come close to LITERALLY getting in bed with a client....

But about 5 months ago I got a call for a rat job.... I thought it was a little odd cause it was a big 4 unit house, the bottom left refused, the bottom right was vacant, top right was the client, and top left WAS THE CLIENTS DOGS APARTMENT.... So we talked and kicked it throughout the course of the service, where he LITERALLY kicked in the door to the vacant apartment so I could enter, and we talked about moving my family in his dogs apartment, cause we were homeless.... 

So fast forward, we've moved in, I've gotten rid of ALL the rats, treated a LITTLE mold, we've gotten comfortable....

So the heat gets cut off, and that's no HUGE problem cause we were about to switch it anyway, but before we got a chance to, a pipe burst.... Now these pipes were messed up when we moved in, it was just on the list of stuff to fix... When it burst we didn't have the money THAT day to fix it so we had to turn off the building water. 1 day and a half later, the other 2 tenants paid to fix it.... ($85)...

That day I get an angry text from my neighbor telling me that he wants us to go... Now on one hand I'm like I get you're upset about the $85 but I can get you your money, on the other I'm like dude ""wtf are you serious?!?? As much work as I've put in here?"" But I go with the later and am like give me a couple days.... 

So within a couple days I have money together for him.... However he's barely saying ANYTHING to me .... I texted and tried to call him about his money.... Turns out he told my ""brother"" as he was leaving ""I don't care about that money, they have to go, I have family I want to move in.....""

WTF?!? I've tried texting/talking to him to reason. The company I work for is TRYING to come back to life, my wife is literally on week 2 of her job.... And now we have to DO EVERYTHING WE CAN to gtfo.... ONLY because I don't want any tension here.... They're GOING to need my help here as the mood situation is going to be BAD, but I don't even care.... We have a special needs child that 1 of HAS to be with so work schedules have always been tricky, but like I said my company has been dead. DM if you would like to help.... But I'm not here about that, I'm PISSED Because THIS UNGRATEFUL MF IT'S TRYING TO PUT MY FAMILY ON THE STREETS FOR NO GOOD REASON!

So my question: **HOW DO YOU PANTSERS DO IT?**

I literally can't conceive of how to start a book with no idea where it's going or how it ends. It's a completely alien concept to me; I'd never attempt it. So I'd like to know:

1. Do you literally have NO idea, or do you have a vague vision?
2. What, if any, elements of the story do you have worked out when starting?
3. Do you really just go where the characters tell you?
4. How do you know when the story is over?
5. What ""clicks"" in you that tells you to start: an interesting character? Scene? Premise? Conversation?",False,writing,t5_2qh2n,self,"To all you ""pantsers""... HOW?",https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/tmqoai/to_all_you_pantsers_how/,2022,3,0.0,,,,,

On the surface you have their most core traits; their name, how they look, stuff like that. Below that you have their history, their history, their family life. And then, below that, you have their desires and their personality and their development. This is the core of their character.

Think about some of the most famous fictional characters. For our purposes, let's use Dave from 2001. His family is not put on focus, his life before going to space is not, none of those surface level traits are in any way important to his character. Just the deep, interesting stuff is. And because of that, Arthur C Clarke made you care about him as soon as possible. He removed the useless elements of his character.

So, in order to writer better characters, remove all the surface level elements that you can; if it serves the story, keep it. If it doesn't, remove it.

Now I saw one of these tattoos before but the other one I didn't which is read as: ""Africa"" but in Arabic, my Arabic isn't the best and the way the tattoo was spelt wasn't how you would pronounce it in english, it was spelt like: ""افريكيا"" and if you pronounce that literally in english, it can be pronounced as: ""Afreekeeyah"". Cut to the end of the day and me and L have drama in the same class and we're in the same group for our drama devised piece. We go on to fix any mistakes we all thought we had of each other and there are like 5 minutes left until the end of school. I see the tattoo of L which is supposed to read as ""Africa"" and then I say: ""hey L why do you have a tattoo which says: Afreekeeyah"" and then he looks visibly pissed and says: ""it says Africa, do you have a problem with that?"" and this guy is normally mad chill about things and is the last guy who you would expect to get pissed (which completely contradicts what I said earlier about him being buff lol). I then reply with: ""Oh shit sorry I thought it said something else"" and this guy looks more pissed and says quietly(because our school does not tolerate swearing at all): ""What the fuck did you think it meant then"" and then slowly gets up and me in a last ditch effort because I think I'm about to get my ass beaten, in an extremely panicked voice says: ""nothing lol it just doesn't literally pronounce as Africa in English like it does in Arabic"" and then he looks to calm down and says: ""oh okay"" and then returns back to normal and sits back down.
